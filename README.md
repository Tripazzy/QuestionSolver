# Solver
## What is Solver?
Solver is a program where you enter a question in human terms, but
still get the answer you need. For example:

    x is 123
    y is 123
    is x equal to y
    
and you'd get the answer!

# The commands
(If you can call them that.)

The commands that this program recognises are similar to human
speech, as you can see below:

* \[x] is \[y]: Set the variable \[x] to \[y]. Can be a string
or number
* what is \[x]: Tells you what \[x] is set to
* what is \[x] plus \[y]: Tells you what \[x] plus \[y] is. \[x]
and \[y] can be either values or variable names.
